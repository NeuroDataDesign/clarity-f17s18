# Cobalt Sprint 2 Goals

##### Team: Vikram Chandrashekhar, Srivathsa PV, Jason Yim, Jonathan Liu

Our sprint 2 goals and assignees are as follows:

1. Registration package with affine and LDDMM registration -- `@vikram`
2. Simple blob detection python package with 1 algorithm (including region-based analysis -- dependent on registration) -- `@srivathsa`
3. demonstrate MVP to reduce gridding artifacts in COLM/La Vision data -- `@jyim`
4. work with `avatr` to help integrate our pipeline into their infrastructure / annotate cell/tractography subvolumes -- `@jonl1096`

# Details:

1. Registration package - we will have a complete registration package that includes both affine and LDDMM registration, and evaluation. To begin, I will evaluate daniel's registration of Control9 and show to ailey. If registration meets spec, then will be tested on all `Insula*` ðŸ§  on the boss and shown to Brian for evaluation. Code will be made available on [Github](https://github.com/neurodata/ndreg) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/neurodata/ndreg/).

2. cell detection package - we will include 1 unsupervised cell counting method that works based on our assessment of the existing methods. We intend to write a summary of the existing methods and their performance (assessed using `blob-metrics`) against our 10 annotated subvolumes starting from the simplest methods (binarization + counting, LoG, DoG, HoG). If/when we show that these methods are less effective, we can optimize our current HDoG algorithm by improving clustering methods used. The cell detection package will use outputs from the registration in order to perform region-based analysis which includes: cell count by region, intensity by region, cell density by region, intensity density by region, etc. Code will be made available on [Github](https://github.com/NeuroDataDesign/bloby).

3. artifact reduction - we will demonstrate an MVP that corrects the bias field per tile in the COLM data. we will begin by surveying methods that exist to correct the bias and begin by trying something simple. Once we have a bias correction method that works we will apply it to all tiles and use terrastitcher to recombine the tiles. The resulting image will be uploaded to the boss to compare to the uncorrected image for qualitative assessment.

4. work with avatr - provide `avatr` with necessary support to integrate our code with their infrastructure. If there isn't a clear weekly goal with avatr, we will spend that week determining how to annotate axons for tractography evaluation or annotating additional cell subvolumes. For all cell volumes annotated with centroids from now on, the centroids will have a consistent format. Centroids will be stored as a csv with the following spec: The first line will be: ```,z,y,x```. Every line after will have the same format where the first column is annotation number and the `z, y, x` coordinates assuming the origin is `0,0,0` where the *top left* of each slice is `x = 0, y = 0` and the *first slice* is `z = 0`.
