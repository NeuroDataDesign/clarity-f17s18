## Simple Blob Detector

- Output of OpenCV's SimpleBlobDetector which is implemented based on
  - Watershed algorithm
  - OTSU's binarization threshold
  - Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)
- False positives are very less
- Can get very good results if combined with [3D reconstruction algorithms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3873529/)

## Distance transform for overlapping cells

- Morphological opening is used to create sure background area and distance transform is performed for sure foreground area.
- This removes ambiguity between overlapping cells and identifies them individually

## Next week

- Based on the sprint timeline discussion, pick one of the unsupervised algorithms and start implementing it
- Validate the algorithmâ€™s performance on the validation sub-volume that is created
