    "    - because there isn't really that much information from the Boss documentation required, so it might be more convienient for the use to just see it along with the ndreg docs\n",
    "    - like in addition to the ndreg_demo notebook, have another demo notebook more catered to registration of brains\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Might also be helpful to have some overall pipeline explanation in the docs (flowchart maybe?) so the user gets a sense of what functionality is available from the ndreg package overall\n"
