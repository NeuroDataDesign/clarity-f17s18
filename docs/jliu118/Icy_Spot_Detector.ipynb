    "\n",
    "\"We present a new method to detect and count bright spots in fluorescence images coming from biological immunomicroscopy experiments. It is based on the multiscale product of subband images resulting from the Ã  trous wavelet transform decomposition of the original image, after thresholding of non-significant coefficients. The multiscale correlation of the filtered wavelet coefficients, which allows to enhance multiscale peaks due to spots while reducing noise, combines information coming from different levels of resolution and gives a clear and distinctive chacterization of the spots. Results are presented for the analysis of typical immunofluorescence images.\"\n",
